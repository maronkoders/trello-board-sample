# trello-board-sample
this is an example of a trello board, done with Laravel and Vue.js


This app is just a mimicked version of Trello boards, But unlike Trello with this app the user can just perform a few activities which namely involves ;
-The creation of columns/ boards
-Viewing of all created Columns,
-Removing of all unwanted columns
-Creation of cards that  belong to a particular board,
-Viewing of all cards per board,
-Removing of all unwanted cards

This is just a simple app, created using the following tech stack
 - Laravel 
 - Vue.js
 - Sass with BEM
 
 For the user to gain access, they should use the following credentials;
